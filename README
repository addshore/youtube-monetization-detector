Random project thinking about trying to detect if a YouTube video is monetized in any way or not...

Run the server

Navigate to something like http://localhost:3000/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlQSCx2nsxo

You'll see a screenshot output from the request, and in the LOG you'll see some details about youtube video ad requests..

The general idea needs testing and refining....
